A curated list of awesome key strokes (or similar stuff) tricks you might or might not know about.


#### Multi-line sub string selection:

This one might known by many people but I have also found an outrageous amount of people that didnt know about it, the way is stated above is present in Sublime Text as well as Pycharm (and all Jetbrains IDEs). It can also be done through key strokes in other IDEs.

#### ls in github:

Another accidental discovery, at any github page you can type "ls" and will put the cursor in the search box
